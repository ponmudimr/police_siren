## My 5-Day Launch into PCB Design 🚀

This project was a rapid, hands-on journey from theory to a physical product. Here's a log of how I designed and built my first custom PCB from scratch, with photos from each stage of the process.

### **Day 1: Unlocking the Lab! 🔑**
The journey began by conquering the basics. I passed the foundational electronics tests, which felt like beating a final boss to unlock the ultimate prize: **full access to the PCB & Fabrication lab**. The real adventure was about to start.

---

### **Day 2: Discovering the World of PCBs 💡**
Next, I dove into the theory of **Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)**. I learned how these essential components are the hidden skeletons inside every gadget we use, providing the foundation for all the electronics.

---

### **Day 3: Architecting the Schematic 📝**
It was time to become an architect for electricity. Using **KiCad**, I designed the **schematic layout**. This is the foundational blueprint that shows how every single component connects logically, serving as the master plan for the circuit.

### **Day 4: Drawing the Copper Highways 🗺️**
With the blueprint done, I moved on to the physical design. This involved assigning **footprints** (the physical pads where components will sit) and then carefully routing the **traces** (the copper pathways connecting them). This is where the board takes its final shape.

*The final PCB layout in KiCad, showing all the copper traces ready for fabrication.*

### **Day 5: The Magic of Fabrication 🔥**
This was the most exciting part! I took my finished design files to the lab and watched as the machine **fabricated the board**. Seeing a digital design get etched into a physical copper-clad board was the perfect reward for all the hard work.

### **Day 6: Assembly, Soldering & Testing 🛠️⚡**

After fabrication, it was time to bring my design to life!  
Before soldering the components, I practiced on a dot board to get better control over my iron and verify the circuit’s working.

*My practice prototype on a dot board, which helped me verify the circuit and improve my soldering skills.*

Once confident, I moved on to the actual PCB and soldered each component — **resistors, LEDs, ICs, capacitors** — with precision and care.  
After assembly, I powered it on for the first test… and the **LEDs blinked perfectly** as per my design! That moment proved every step of the process was successful.
