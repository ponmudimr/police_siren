## My 5-Day Launch into PCB Design 🚀

This project was a rapid, hands-on journey from theory to a physical product. Here's a log of how I built my first custom PCB from scratch in just one week.

### **Day 1: Unlocking the Lab! 🔑**
The first challenge was to prove I had the basics down. I tackled the foundational electronics tests and passed! It felt like beating a final boss in a video game, and my reward was the ultimate prize: **full access to the PCB & Fabrication lab**. The real fun was about to begin.

### **Day 2: Discovering the Blueprint of Electronics 🗺️**
Today, I learned about the magic behind every gadget we own: the **Printed Circuit Board (PCB)**. I discovered how these neat green boards are the hidden skeletons that make our phones, laptops, and consoles work. It was mind-blowing to realize I was about to make my own.

### **Day 3: Bringing My Circuit to Life in KiCad ✨**
It was time to become an architect for electricity. Using a powerful software called **KiCad**, I started designing my police siren circuit. First, I drew the schematic (the master plan), then I began laying out the tiny copper "highways" for the electricity to follow. It felt like solving a creative puzzle!

### **Day 4: Hitting 'Print' on a Real-Life Circuit! 🏭**
This was the moment of truth! I sent my completed digital design to our campus fabrication lab. The idea that something I designed on a screen was being physically etched into a real copper board just a few buildings away was incredibly exciting. The countdown to holding it in my hands had officially started.

### **Day 5: Taming the Soldering Iron 🔥**
While my custom PCB was being born, I got to learn a classic electronics skill: **soldering**. Armed with a soldering iron and a practice "dot board," I learned the art of melting metal to forge strong electrical connections. There's nothing quite like the smell of solder and the satisfaction of seeing components perfectly locked in place!
